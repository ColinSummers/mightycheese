<h2>thu dec 21 2006</h2>
							<p>Went to Las Vegas. Should have had more water on the flight. Should have eaten better, planned more. Who knows. Midway through the day, after a visit to the Slammer I knew I was in trouble. Stupidly, I didn't have my computer bag with me, so I didn't have anything to take. The meeting at the Castle went two and half hours instead of twenty minutes. I tried to rest on the flight home. When I got back to house I was already feeling a headache in the base of my skull, so I took half a dose of Vicodin. </p>
<p>I didn't feel stoned, but I felt drifty during some of the night's sleep. I felt some of the headache try to get through and I was really glad not to have to take a full dose.</p>
