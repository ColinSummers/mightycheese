<div><p>Oops. Spoke too soon. At least I made it through a single day of 2007 without a migraine...</p>
<p>Flew on the red-eye from Los Angeles to Boston. Drove three and a half hours in a rental SUV along the Mass Pike under gloomy skies with boys boys asleep up to Vermont to see my parents. There was no snow. My sister was there with her two kids and my sister-in-law with my new five-month old niece. </p>
<p>Dinner was good. My nephew Jasper had a screaming meltdown tantrum. My sister-in-law had fallen down the stairs at the moment of my arrival. My parents didn't seem that happy with one another. Stress stress stress.</p>
<p>I had a slight headache before dinner, but figured it was from not eating on schedule. I thought it would fade after dinner. Then I figured it was jet lag. I hoped I would be better with some sleep. I surfed in and out of sleep starting around 10pm and at 1am woke up not sure if I could make it into the bathroom. I was definitely not looking forward to turning on the light. I was happy that there was a night light in there, so I could get to the Vicodin in my travel kit without turning anything bright on.</p>
<p>I remembered, as I waited for the Vicodin to hit&nbsp; (which it did after about forty minutes), all sorts of weird images from the half-sleep while the migraine got worse. That the pain was a pair of chisels being scraped on the inside of my skull, and that the different positions I would rolls to seemed to roll the chisels and change the pain a little. Was it the flat edge dragging or the sharp one? Was it dragging on the side of my skull or along the top?</p>
<p>In the morning I had the usual symptoms post-migraine. Loss of vocabulary, slight lack of coordination, some sluggishness. </p>
