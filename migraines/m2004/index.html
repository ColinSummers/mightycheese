Yesterday was a bad day. Near the end of the day I had no strengthleft and I felt a sore throat and a headache coming. I don't know if it was going to be an ulcerated sore throat or a migraine. I didn'tcare. I just wanted to go to sleep and not think about things anymore.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
<br />
I believe my sponsor would have given me one from his own stash, truth be told.
<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
<br />
[Pretty sure it was a migraine, not the sore throat. The end of a long, stressful week.]

<div>I took three Excedrin tonight. I can't rype&nbsp;at all. Fuck you for it. I was headed to Clair'es fortieth birthday&nbsp;party. I had dealt with my mom being in town since Tuesday. I was&nbsp;maxed out for figuring people out and knowing how to talk. Took a nice&nbsp;shower. Got dressed. Wham. Giant steps on my head.</div>
<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
</div>
<div>After the throat the vicodin make me a little dread filled when I&nbsp;think of it. So I took a couple Excedrin. Took the edge off the pain.&nbsp;A few hours later I took another. Kept the shooting&nbsp;have-to-be-horizontal pain down to a tolerable level where sometimes I&nbsp;could actually concentrate on what someone was saying. Most of the&nbsp;time I just talked, which is much easier than listening.</div>

<div><span class="Apple-style-span">I could feel another migraine coming. Something is fucked up. I'm not&nbsp;sure what. It's like there's a secret I know there is hidden from me,&nbsp;and I can't know it. I can't scrape the surface of what it is. I don't&nbsp;even know what it is about. I think Nell could tell me, but I have no&nbsp;idea. Now I am a crackhead. Paranoid, delusional, and whining. My&nbsp;tongue was twitching by mid-morning, but I had a plan: collect Nell's&nbsp;sister Alice from the airport, drop her at Claire's, have a late lunch&nbsp;with coke (ah, sugar, caffeine), and work at the studio until 4pm.<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
That way when I took the Vicodin I knew that it would take me all the&nbsp;way until sleep at 9pm.</div>
<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
That's what I did.</div>
<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
It took an hour for my scowl to relax, and my tongue to stop&nbsp;twitching. It had folded over, actually. It wasn't even full blown&nbsp;when I took the Vicodin. What the fuck.</div>
<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
I think I need some sort of vacation. I am scared to leave the boys,&nbsp;which is part of the paranoia.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />

<div><span class="Apple-style-span">I came home last night with a migraine. More accurately, a migraine&nbsp;attacked me during Borne Supremacy, erasing a lot of my vocabulary and&nbsp;swelling my twitching tongue. My cell phone battery died, so I had&nbsp;just enough juice to call home and hear Nell say, "Can you bring me&nbsp;some water when you come to bed?" I sat in the car for a few minutes&nbsp;trying to decide what to do. I drove home with the window down, music&nbsp;on just enough to cover some of the road noise but not enough to&nbsp;really hear. I was refrigerated, which I think helped. But soon after&nbsp;I hit Sunset I knew I couldn't navigate home on my own, the lights and&nbsp;speed limit didn't make any sense and I could only see out of one eye.&nbsp;I waited at a light, blinking. Then I picked the car in front of me,&nbsp;tried to pay attention to its blinkers so I didn't wind up in the&nbsp;wrong part of town, and followed it all the way along Sunset to&nbsp;Brentwood. It turned off there, and I was on autopilot for home.</span></div>
<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
</div>
<div>I thought Nell might be able to make the headache go away, which she&nbsp;has done once in the past, but she was mostly asleep. She brought me a&nbsp;vicodin when it was clear I was not going to drift off with my skull&nbsp;in a vise and a railroad spike being driven through the back of it.</div>

<div><span class="Apple-style-span">Last weekend (July 26th) I had spent the day with the boys. Nell was&nbsp;writing. In the evening we were meant to go to a party. Birthday&nbsp;dinner at a friend's house. Lots of people. Starting in the afternoon I&nbsp;started to get a headache. I took a twenty minute nap. Woke up, it was&nbsp;worse. I had a coke (sugar! caffeine!). It got worse. I gave up and&nbsp;took a Vicodin.<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
It was great. It allowed me to talk to an actress for over an&nbsp;hour. I doubt there's a better test for a drug.

I started getting a headache around 6pm. I thought it might be lack of&nbsp;caffeine through the day, so I snagged a coke. It kept coming. I had&nbsp;some dinner. Still coming. I guzzled some water, had some pineapple&nbsp;for a sugar rush.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
<br />
</div>
<div>Still coming. Now pounding. Okay. Now I was stupid.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
<br />
</div>
<div>7:20pm took a Vicodin. Wondered when I would start taking two at a time.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
<br />
</div>
<div>It was 9:15pm before it actually wiped out the headache. That was a bummer.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />

<div>Take them sooner. Why can't I learn that?<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />

<div>That worked perfectly. Around 4pm my tongue was quivering if I pressed&nbsp;it to the roof of my mouth, which so far has been the best indicator&nbsp;that a migraine is coming. At 6:30pm I took the vicodin. At around&nbsp;7:40pm while I was at a dinner party I felt the migraine try to sneak&nbsp;in under the vicodin.</div>
<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
</div>
<div>Right now, at 10pm, I can feel it pressing on the back of my skull,&nbsp;low on the right side, and in a straight line through to the front, to&nbsp;the left of my nose. There's some tension in the muscles across my&nbsp;head, but I can only feel the slightest, dullest pain.</div>
<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
</div>
<div>Excellent.</div>
<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
</div>
<div>Carry on, crackheads.</div>
