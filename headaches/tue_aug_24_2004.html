<div><span class="Apple-style-span">I came home last night with a migraine. More accurately, a migraine&nbsp;attacked me during Borne Supremacy, erasing a lot of my vocabulary and&nbsp;swelling my twitching tongue. My cell phone battery died, so I had&nbsp;just enough juice to call home and hear Nell say, "Can you bring me&nbsp;some water when you come to bed?" I sat in the car for a few minutes&nbsp;trying to decide what to do. I drove home with the window down, music&nbsp;on just enough to cover some of the road noise but not enough to&nbsp;really hear. I was refrigerated, which I think helped. But soon after&nbsp;I hit Sunset I knew I couldn't navigate home on my own, the lights and&nbsp;speed limit didn't make any sense and I could only see out of one eye.&nbsp;I waited at a light, blinking. Then I picked the car in front of me,&nbsp;tried to pay attention to its blinkers so I didn't wind up in the&nbsp;wrong part of town, and followed it all the way along Sunset to&nbsp;Brentwood. It turned off there, and I was on autopilot for home.</span></div>

<div>I thought Nell might be able to make the headache go away, which she&nbsp;has done once in the past, but she was mostly asleep. She brought me a&nbsp;vicodin when it was clear I was not going to drift off with my skull&nbsp;in a vise and a railroad spike being driven through the back of it.
