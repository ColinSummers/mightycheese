<h2>Tue Oct 31 2006</h2>

<p>We had the LaZebniks, Dellaversons, and Raimis over for pre-trick-r-treat. It was great. Then the food was delayed, two people came along as guests of the guests, Dexter had an unannounced play date which lasted until we had guests arriving...</p>
<p>I felt my blood pressure rising. So I took half a dose of Vicodin, which is my new plan. I tried Advil once, and that didn't work (there's no pain for it to block). I have a feeling that blood pressure medication would also help, and that Valium (or whatever the modern&nbsp;equivalent is) would work too.</p>
<p>I feel like I almost have enough data to show a doctor. I believe I take two Vicodin a month on average.</p>
