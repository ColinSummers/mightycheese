<h2>2005</h2>

<p>Fewer than I would have expected. I might not have been keeping careful track, although I was already writing to Dean when I took a Vicodin, so I <span><i>should</i></span>&nbsp;have an entry for each headache.</p>

</i></span>I am sorry to have a headache on your birthday. I took a vicodin when a shower, some quiet, and reading with Dexter did nothing to slow down the migraine. By 9pm I should be fine, but a little loopy. I would love to watch something with you.</div></li>

<p>A three hour meeting in the Valley with a client on a project that we should have been fired from months ago. I knew on the way home that I was going to have a migraine. I might have had it by the time I made it off the 405. Took a Vicodin and ended my day a little early.</p>

I am back from meetings in Vegas. I thought napping on the plane wouldhelp. My tongue is trembling and my skull is starting to squeeze my brain like a sponge.<br />

Captain V to the rescue.
