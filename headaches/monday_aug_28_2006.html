<h2>Monday, Aug 28 2006</h2>

<p>I flew to Las Vegas to look at the two projects there. The Castle looked great. The Slammer's Cellblock B addition is nearly complete. The interior decoration, in places, totally obscures the design intentions I had for the space. I am probably the only person who will notice. The clients are happy with the project, the contractor seems pleased with his work, the interior decorator is proud of what he has done... it's just me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called Nell while returning to the airport and broke down on the phone. That was unusual. I stayed in the air-conditioned terminal for a short while planning my flight home and determining if I was okay to fly myself. I decided that the distraction of the piloting task was a good thing, and that if it wasn't, I would easily have twenty minutes to get to an airport if I needed to stop flying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I flew home and I could feel all the little pieces of space definition that I like to see blinking off. I took a Vicodin and lay down. I spent some time with the boys and with Nell and went to sleep.</p>
