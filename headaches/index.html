<h2>Headaches</h2>

<p>For a long time I have ignored the frequency of my migraines and figured that each one that I had would just be the last one. Starting tonight (August 2006) I will keep a log of them, so that as I try to find a solution I will have a record to work from. I have learned some things, which is good, but I need to get better. They are bad to have and I need to figure out how to manage or avoid them entirely.</p>
<p>I will work on a history page, because I have had them since I was twelve or thirteen. I had them regularly in college, then frequently soon after college, and then I had an eight year break from them when Nell and I first got together. Fairly recently, they returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stupidly, it shows them in alphabetically order. Ah well. If you click on the year you get a page with the entries in the correct order (most recent at top, like a blog). Here they are sorted by day, which is something.</p>

</br>Dexter was amazing and had an astonishingly great time. The last day there he really missed Rudy, home and Nell. I think in that order, but all of them a lot. He had grown wearing of being the big brother to his cousin Willa, who is two and a half. Initially he loved that he got to decide so many things, but by the end he was looking forward to Rudy's benign dictatorship.<br class='webkit-block-placeholder'>
