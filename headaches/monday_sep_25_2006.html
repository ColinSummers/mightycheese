<h2>Monday, Sep 25 2006</h2>

<p>I might not have eaten well enough on Sunday. An almond croissant in the morning, a Jamba Juice, a Koo Koo Roo Cookie... I bet I didn't eat enough. But it was an easy day mostly of being with Dexter. When I was going to sleep around 10:30pm I had a slight headache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I woke up around 2:30am with more than a slight headache. It seemed like it might become a migraine. My tongue felt funny. I was too sleepy to know if my vision was off or if I was losing vocabulary (two other good indicators). I thought I might need to have some calories, something in my stomach. I went and had a few spoonfuls of Cherry Garcia, read Wired magazine a little, and got back into bed around 3:15am. I drifted off the sleep.</p>
<p>I woke up at 6:05am and turned off my alarm. The headache was already bad and it was a relief to slip back into sleep. Nell's alarm went off a little later and I decided to try a hot shower. It didn't work. I gave up and took a Vicodin at 7:15am. Sometime around 7:40am I felt the pressure dissipate, or at least the pain was masked. I lost most of the usual things I lose when I get a migraine. The worst part is that my reaction to the Vicodin seems to be getting worse. I used to just feel warm and cozy and the pain would go away. Now I almost always have a fifteen minute period of nausea. This morning I lay down on the couch for about half an hour.
</p>
<p>I was loopy until a little after lunch and didn't drive. I wasn't that useful at the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Vicodin worked and killed the pain, but it was still a bad headache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the first time I can remember waking up with a migraine.</p>
