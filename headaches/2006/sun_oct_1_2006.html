<h2>sun oct 1 2006</h2>

<p>It was a long day. There was a play date for Rudy and Haskell in the morning, lunch with Justin Lazard (an old, troubled friend), and dinner with the LaZebniks and Mel &amp; Lilla in the evening (starting in the late afternoon). After fielding some scheduling issues (Nell running out just as her father arrived, Dexter not wanting to play even though Annie was there, Rudy wanting to read instead of engaging with Johnny), I went to get the ribs with Mel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my return, even after a relaxing walk to the store for beverages, I could tell that it was a headache event, so I took half a Vicodin. I didn't get sweaty, nauseous, or stoned feeling. I didn't get even a hint of a headache. It is 10pm and I feel a little more sleepy than usual.</p>
