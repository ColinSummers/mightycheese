<p>The morning opening presents was great. Being with Nell, the boys, and their cousins was all fun. Taking the three youngest to Charlotte's Web and handling them for lunch was easy. We met up with Nell's brother Ted and his family. Again, all without stress. Then we were meant to go to friends' for dinner, with all of the above family and two other families (and their kids). That seemed like too high stress. I took half a dose of Vicodin and I was fine. Never felt stoned, never had the feeling of a heada…</div>

<p>Went to Las Vegas. Should have had more water on the flight. Should have eaten better, planned more. Who knows. Midway through the day, after a visit to the Slammer I knew I was in trouble. Stupidly, I didn't have my computer bag with me, so I didn't have anything to take. The meeting at the Castle went two and half hours instead of twenty minutes. I tried to rest on the flight home. When I got back to house I was already feeling a headache in the base of my skull, so I took half a dose of Vicodin. </p>…</div>

<p>The annual dinner for our little investment club was tonight. I spent the day fielding questions about my parents' loft and helping my business partner deal with the memo we needed to send the contractor. I took half a dose of Vicodin before going to the dinner at 7pm. It lasted until 11pm. I never felt stoned or loopy at the dinner, but once I lay down to go to sleep I felt drifty, the room spun a little, and I had trouble sleeping. (The opiate does that.

<p>We dropped Dexter for a movie and dinner with H. Rudy was dropped for a birthday dinner with a different H. Nell and I went to the promenade and tried on jeans and the&nbsp;fluorescent lighting and unhelpful staff in the places we went into started to give me a little headache. We picked Rudy up and went to our friends' the B's for dinner and desserts. While there I started to feel worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I felt my blood pressure rising. So I took half a dose of Vicodin, which is my new plan. I tried Advil once, and that didn't work (there's no pain for it to block). I have a feeling that blood pressure medication would also help, and that Valium (or whateve…</div>

<p>I didn't realize that I was going to be in the sun, dealing with a hundred strangers, and working retail. So I took a Vicodin before heading down to the Franklin Halloween Festival. Last three years I have returned and napped through a slight headache. This year I feel okay.</p>
<p>I just wonder if a Valium would be better. I feel no effects at all from the Vicodin, I just don't have a headache and I'm not stressed out from the two hours.</p>
