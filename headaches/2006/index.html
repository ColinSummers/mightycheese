<h2>2006</h2>

<p>I seem to have gotten better at identifying when I will get a migraine, but I've made no progress on handling them without drugs.</p>

<div class="summary"><p>The morning opening presents was great. Being with Nell, the boys, and their cousins was all fun. Taking the three youngest to Charlotte's Web and handling them for lunch was easy. We met up with Nell's brother Ted and his family. Again, all without stress. Then we were meant to go to friends' for dinner, with all of the above family and two other families (and their kids). That seemed like too high stress. I took half a dose of Vicodin and I was fine. Never felt stoned, never had the feeling of a heada…</div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>Went to Las Vegas. Should have had more water on the flight. Should have eaten better, planned more. Who knows. Midway through the day, after a visit to the Slammer I knew I was in trouble. Stupidly, I didn't have my computer bag with me, so I didn't have anything to take. The meeting at the Castle went two and half hours instead of twenty minutes. I tried to rest on the flight home. When I got back to house I was already feeling a headache in the base of my skull, so I took half a dose of Vicodin. </p>…</div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>The annual dinner for our little investment club was tonight. I spent the day fielding questions about my parents' loft and helping my business partner deal with the memo we needed to send the contractor. I took half a dose of Vicodin before going to the dinner at 7pm. It lasted until 11pm. I never felt stoned or loopy at the dinner, but once I lay down to go to sleep I felt drifty, the room spun a little, and I had trouble sleeping. (The opiate does that. I go into a nodding state of dreaming often, bu…</div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>We went to a huge (hundreds of people) holiday party. I hadn't slept well the night before and felt edgy and tongue-trembly. I took half a Vicodin dose and was fine the entire evening. I never felt loopy, but didn't get a headache.</p></div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>The boys had a bit of a busy weekend planned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We dropped Dexter for a movie and dinner with H. Rudy was dropped for a birthday dinner with a different H. Nell and I went to the promenade and tried on jeans and the&nbsp;fluorescent lighting and unhelpful staff in the places we went into started to give me a little headache. We picked Rudy up and went to our friends' the B's for dinner and desserts. While there I started to feel worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were a few guests that seemed extraordinary. A woman…</div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>I attended the get together for Rudy's class parents. Nell was meant to meet me there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They all seemed like very nice people, but trying to keep names and faces straight for two and a half hours is a strain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half dose of Vicodin. No migraine yet, half an hour later. I would like to not have one.</p></div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>We had the LaZebniks, Dellaversons, and Raimis over for pre-trick-r-treat. It was great. Then the food was delayed, two people came along as guests of the guests, Dexter had an unannounced play date which lasted until we had guests arriving...</p>
<p>I felt my blood pressure rising. So I took half a dose of Vicodin, which is my new plan. I tried Advil once, and that didn't work (there's no pain for it to block). I have a feeling that blood pressure medication would also help, and that Valium (or whateve…</div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>I didn't realize that I was going to be in the sun, dealing with a hundred strangers, and working retail. So I took a Vicodin before heading down to the Franklin Halloween Festival. Last three years I have returned and napped through a slight headache. This year I feel okay.</p>
<p>I just wonder if a Valium would be better. I feel no effects at all from the Vicodin, I just don't have a headache and I'm not stressed out from the two hours.</p></div></li>
<li><a href="sun_oct_1_2006.html">sun oct 1 2006</a>
<div class="summary"><p>It was a long day. There was a play date for Rudy and Haskell in the morning, lunch with Justin Lazard (an old, troubled friend), and dinner with the LaZebniks and Mel &amp; Lilla in the evening (starting in the late afternoon). After fielding some scheduling issues (Nell running out just as her father arrived, Dexter not wanting to play even though Annie was there, Rudy wanting to read instead of engaging with Johnny), I went to get the ribs with Mel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my return, even after a relaxing walk t…</div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>I might not have eaten well enough on Sunday. An almond croissant in the morning, a Jamba Juice, a Koo Koo Roo Cookie... I bet I didn't eat enough. But it was an easy day mostly of being with Dexter. When I was going to sleep around 10:30pm I had a slight headache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I woke up around 2:30am with more than a slight headache. It seemed like it might become a migraine. My tongue felt funny. I was too sleepy to know if my vision was off or if I was losing vocabulary (two other good indicators). I tho…</div></li>

<div class="summary"><p><span class="Apple-style-span">Nell read in the NY Times that the latest study showed the management of migraines with a dose of something (Vicodin, Valium) <span class="Apple-style-span">before</span>&nbsp;the onset meant for a much better overall experience. I have noticed this myself, but it makes me feel like a drug addict, because I am taking an opiate before I have any real pain.</span></p>

<div class="summary"><p>I flew to Las Vegas to look at the two projects there. The Castle looked great. The Slammer's Cellblock B addition is nearly complete. The interior decoration, in places, totally obscures the design intentions I had for the space. I am probably the only person who will notice. The clients are happy with the project, the contractor seems pleased with his work, the interior decorator is proud of what he has done... it's just me.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="summary"><p>Returning from the Lake in Canada is an olympic event. I am responsible for both boys, there is a tight schedule, and I'm going through airport security <i>and</i>&nbsp;customs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was horrible traffic coming into Toronto on Monday night. We had a reservation at the revolving restaurant, and it took us so long to get to the hotel that I was worried we would miss the dinner time. The boys were great, but I seemed to have lost my long pants. I had to get them both bathed, and they were a little d…</div></li>

<p>It seemed like you were extra nice to me last night, and I thought it was because you knew I was trying to avoid a headache (nearly successful, I had sort of half a headache through the Vicodin. Being a little dopey was better than being crushed by the pain, though, and this morning I don't really feel like I had a migraine last night, which is an improvement.</p></div></li>

<div class="summary"><p>Not sure. Gary Stockdale mentions in email on the following day "I hope you got rid of your migraine." If it was bad enough to mention to him them it was bad enough that I probably took something for it, most likely a Vicodin.</p></div></li>
