<p>The boys had a bit of a busy weekend planned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We dropped Dexter for a movie and dinner with H. Rudy was dropped for a birthday dinner with a different H. Nell and I went to the promenade and tried on jeans and the&nbsp;fluorescent lighting and unhelpful staff in the places we went into started to give me a little headache. We picked Rudy up and went to our friends' the B's for dinner and desserts. While there I started to feel worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were a few guests that seemed extraordinary. A woman with way too much money complained about how horrible it was that terrorists would target the beauty of cities like Los Angeles and New York. She seemed beyond belief, not a real character. Then the big muscle guy arrived with his little white poodle. I was trying to track everyone. It was impossible. The kids were shrieking. At about 8:15 I knew I had to leave. At 8:30 I told Nell I had to walk home, leaving her and Rudy there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The walk was nice. It was dark, cool, and a little damp. I lost sense of time. As soon as I was home I took two Vicodin. They took over an hour to take effect because of the amount of food in my belly. I lay on the bed while Nell came home, made a phone call, got Rudy into bed and so forth. Finally, at about 10:00 the Vicodin took effect and I watched a little of The Hulk with Rudy before he went to sleep.</p>
<p>I slept fitfully, in bits and pieces, waking constantly until 2:45am. Then I was only up every fifteen minutes until 5:45am when I feel completely asleep.</p>
<p>In the morning I felt awful. Particularly wiped out and hollow. I cancelled any thought of going flying.</p>
