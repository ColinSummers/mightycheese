<h2>sunday, dec 10 2006</h2>

<p>The annual dinner for our little investment club was tonight. I spent the day fielding questions about my parents' loft and helping my business partner deal with the memo we needed to send the contractor. I took half a dose of Vicodin before going to the dinner at 7pm. It lasted until 11pm. I never felt stoned or loopy at the dinner, but once I lay down to go to sleep I felt drifty, the room spun a little, and I had trouble sleeping. (The opiate does that. I go into a nodding state of dreaming often, but not really sleeping.)</p>
