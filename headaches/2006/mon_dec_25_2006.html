<h2>mon dec 25 2006</h2>

<p>The morning opening presents was great. Being with Nell, the boys, and their cousins was all fun. Taking the three youngest to Charlotte's Web and handling them for lunch was easy. We met up with Nell's brother Ted and his family. Again, all without stress. Then we were meant to go to friends' for dinner, with all of the above family and two other families (and their kids). That seemed like too high stress. I took half a dose of Vicodin and I was fine. Never felt stoned, never had the feeling of a headache coming. No problem sleeping.</p>
