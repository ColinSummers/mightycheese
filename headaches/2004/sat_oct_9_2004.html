<span class="Apple-style-span">To Dean in Gmail:&nbsp;</span>

<div>I took three Excedrin tonight. I can't rype&nbsp;at all. Fuck you for it. I was headed to Clair'es fortieth birthday&nbsp;party. I had dealt with my mom being in town since Tuesday. I was&nbsp;maxed out for figuring people out and knowing how to talk. Took a nice&nbsp;shower. Got dressed. Wham. Giant steps on my head.</div>

<div>After the throat the vicodin make me a little dread filled when I&nbsp;think of it. So I took a couple Excedrin. Took the edge off the pain.&nbsp;A few hours later I took another. Kept the shooting&nbsp;have-to-be-horizontal pain down to a tolerable level where sometimes I&nbsp;could actually concentrate on what someone was saying. Most of the&nbsp;time I just talked, which is much easier than listening.
