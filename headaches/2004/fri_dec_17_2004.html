<i>To Dean in Gmail:</i><i><br />

Yesterday was a bad day. Near the end of the day I had no strengthleft and I felt a sore throat and a headache coming. I don't know if it was going to be an ulcerated sore throat or a migraine. I didn'tcare. I just wanted to go to sleep and not think about things anymore.<br />
<br />
I believe my sponsor would have given me one from his own stash, truth be told.
<br />
<br />
[Pretty sure it was a migraine, not the sore throat. The end of a long, stressful week.]
