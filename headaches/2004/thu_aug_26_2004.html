<div><span class="Apple-style-span">I could feel another migraine coming. Something is fucked up. I'm not&nbsp;sure what. It's like there's a secret I know there is hidden from me,&nbsp;and I can't know it. I can't scrape the surface of what it is. I don't&nbsp;even know what it is about. I think Nell could tell me, but I have no&nbsp;idea. Now I am a crackhead. Paranoid, delusional, and whining. My&nbsp;tongue was twitching by mid-morning, but I had a plan: collect Nell's&nbsp;sister Alice from the airport, drop her at Claire's, have a late lunch&nbsp;with coke (ah, sugar, caffeine), and work at the studio until 4pm.<div><br />
That way when I took the Vicodin I knew that it would take me all the&nbsp;way until sleep at 9pm.
<div><br />
That's what I did.</div>
<div><br />
It took an hour for my scowl to relax, and my tongue to stop&nbsp;twitching. It had folded over, actually. It wasn't even full blown&nbsp;when I took the Vicodin. What the fuck.</div>
<div><br />
I think I need some sort of vacation. I am scared to leave the boys,&nbsp;which is part of the paranoia.<br />
