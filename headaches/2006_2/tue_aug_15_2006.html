<p>Returning from the Lake in Canada is an olympic event. I am responsible for both boys, there is a tight schedule, and I'm going through airport security <i>and</i>&nbsp;customs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was horrible traffic coming into Toronto on Monday night. We had a reservation at the revolving restaurant, and it took us so long to get to the hotel that I was worried we would miss the dinner time. The boys were great, but I seemed to have lost my long pants. I had to get them both bathed, and they were a little dazed from the car ride down. Traffic into downtown Toronto was terrible, apparently I had coincided with the global AIDS conference. Excellent. We parked and wandered the base of the CN Tower in fog trying to find the way up. Dinner was magnificent.</p>
<p>We returned to the hotel and the boys went to sleep after a movie. I was up most of the night thinking about the things I needed to do on my return and how I was going to get home. What I needed to bring to the airport for the boys and what they were going to be doing on the flight home. I could feel the migraine at the base of my skull, but I willed it away. I couldn't have one <i>and</i>&nbsp;take care of the boys, so I decided I would just relax and focus and not have it until I was on the airplane.</p>
<p>The next morning it was a bums rush to the airport with a poor breakfast in a pastry shop next to the hotel. Canada, the can't do country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We made it there, returned the car, stood in line, got boarding passes, stood in line, ignored the fascists, stood in line... Learned that we could not bring bottles of water onto the plane. Stood in line. I felt the migraine coming like a train down the line from the next town. I took a Vicodin so that it would not stop at <i>this</i>&nbsp;town. We boarded the plane. I had a bad ten minutes of sweating and nausea, which seemed to be from the Vicodin, and then I was fine (but a little stoned) for the rest of the trip.</p>
