&lt;p&gt;Not sure. Gary Stockdale mentions in email on the following day "I hope you got rid of your migraine." If it was bad enough to mention to him them it was bad enough that I probably took something for it, most likely a Vicodin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like you were extra nice to me last night, and I thought it was because you knew I was trying to avoid a headache (nearly successful, I had sort of half a headache through the Vicodin. Being a little dopey was better than being crushed by the pain, though, and this morning I don't really feel like I had a migraine last night, which is an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the LaZebniks, Dellaversons, and Raimis over for pre-trick-r-treat. It was great. Then the food was delayed, two people came along as guests of the guests, Dexter had an unannounced play date which lasted until we had guests arriving...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt my blood pressure rising. So I took half a dose of Vicodin, which is my new plan. I tried Advil once, and that didn't work (there's no pain for it to block). I have a feeling that blood pressure medication would also help, and that Valium (or whateve…

&lt;p&gt;I didn't realize that I was going to be in the sun, dealing with a hundred strangers, and working retail. So I took a Vicodin before heading down to the Franklin Halloween Festival. Last three years I have returned and napped through a slight headache. This year I feel okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wonder if a Valium would be better. I feel no effects at all from the Vicodin, I just don't have a headache and I'm not stressed out from the two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long day. There was a play date for Rudy and Haskell in the morning, lunch with Justin Lazard (an old, troubled friend), and dinner with the LaZebniks and Mel &amp;amp; Lilla in the evening (starting in the late afternoon). After fielding some scheduling issues (Nell running out just as her father arrived, Dexter not wanting to play even though Annie was there, Rudy wanting to read instead of engaging with Johnny), I went to get the ribs with Mel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my return, even after a relaxing walk t…

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Nell read in the NY Times that the latest study showed the management of migraines with a dose of something (Vicodin, Valium) &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; the onset meant for a much better overall experience. I have noticed this myself, but it makes me feel like a drug addict, because I am taking an opiate before I have any real pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nell's sister was having a big party (two hundred people) to celebrate the publica…

&lt;p&gt;Returning from the Lake in Canada is an olympic event. I am responsible for both boys, there is a tight schedule, and I'm going through airport security &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; customs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was horrible traffic coming into Toronto on Monday night. We had a reservation at the revolving restaurant, and it took us so long to get to the hotel that I was worried we would miss the dinner time. The boys were great, but I seemed to have lost my long pants. I had to get them both bathed, and they were a little d…

&lt;p&gt;I flew to Las Vegas to look at the two projects there. The Castle looked great. The Slammer's Cellblock B addition is nearly complete. The interior decoration, in places, totally obscures the design intentions I had for the space. I am probably the only person who will notice. The clients are happy with the project, the contractor seems pleased with his work, the interior decorator is proud of what he has done... it's just me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called Nell while returning to the airport and broke down on the ph…

&lt;p&gt;I might not have eaten well enough on Sunday. An almond croissant in the morning, a Jamba Juice, a Koo Koo Roo Cookie... I bet I didn't eat enough. But it was an easy day mostly of being with Dexter. When I was going to sleep around 10:30pm I had a slight headache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up around 2:30am with more than a slight headache. It seemed like it might become a migraine. My tongue felt funny. I was too sleepy to know if my vision was off or if I was losing vocabulary (two other good indicators). I tho…
