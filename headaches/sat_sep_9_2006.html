<h2>Sat Sep 9 2006</h2>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Nell read in the NY Times that the latest study showed the management of migraines with a dose of something (Vicodin, Valium) <span class="Apple-style-span">before</span>&nbsp;the onset meant for a much better overall experience. I have noticed this myself, but it makes me feel like a drug addict, because I am taking an opiate before I have any real pain.</span></p>
<p>Nell's sister was having a big party (two hundred people) to celebrate the publication of her second novel. We got baby sitting and went. There would be a ton of people there who I sort of knew, but knew that I would have trouble remember the names of or talking to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did remarkably well and it was only two hours into it that I started to feel a migraine start to sneak up. I went to the bathroom, took a Vicodin and was fine for the rest of the night.</p>
