<p>Fewer than I would have expected. I might not have been keeping careful track, although I was already writing to Dean when I took a Vicodin, so I <i>should</i>&nbsp;have an entry for each headache.</p>

I am back from meetings in Vegas. I thought napping on the plane wouldhelp. My tongue is trembling and my skull is starting to squeeze my brain like a sponge.</p>
<p>
Captain V to the rescue.

<h3>tue feb 1 2005</h3>
<p><i>To Dean in Gmail:</i></p>
<p>A three hour meeting in the Valley with a client on a project that we should have been fired from months ago. I knew on the way home that I was going to have a migraine. I might have had it by the time I made it off the 405. Took a Vicodin and ended my day a little early.</p>

<h3>tue nov 8 2005</h3>
<i>To Nell in mail:</i><p><i><br />
</i>I am sorry to have a headache on your birthday. I took a vicodin when a shower, some quiet, and reading with Dexter did nothing to slow down the migraine. By 9pm I should be fine, but a little loopy. I would love to watch something with you.</p>
<p>Part of my stress is a feeling of fucking this up. I like working hard, getting paid for my time, and seeing the result. I don't like the nebulous "you've left money on the table" or "you've scared them off" feelings I get from this deal. [I was selling tightcircle at the time.]
