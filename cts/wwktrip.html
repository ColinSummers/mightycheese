<h2><a href="./">cts</a> | A Look Back</h2>
<p>last updated August 28 1999</p>
<p>Aug 28: The trip was a huge success. Photos will be posted soon to Rudy &amp; Dexter's web site.</p>
<p>We are all headed east in August. Well, in bunches.</p>
<p>First, Colin will fly to Boston, get picked up by Adam, drive to Amherst and then help Adam drive all four tons of his belongs (books are heavy, t-shirts aren't) in a twenty-five foot truck across the country to Berkeley. (Colin will actually bail out a couple hours before the destination, so that he flies out of a smaller airport.)</p>
<p>Then, Adam will fly down to Los Angeles, connect with Colin, Dexter, and Rudy and the four of them will fly back across the country to Toronto, Canada. They will rent a car and drive North to the Lake. They will spend a week on the Lake.</p>
<p>After the Lake, Adam, Colin, Dexter and Rudy will drive back down to Toronto. Adam will fly back out to Los Angeles (and then up to Oakland), while Colin will continue with the boys to Boston. That night, Nell will take the red-eye to Boston, meeting up with everyone on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>After brunch at the Martin-Shaw's (with the Strazi) we'll head to New Hampshire for a few nights on Pleasant Lake with Mel &amp; Sooky.</p>
<p>Thursday afternoon we will fly out of Boston, headed for home. The details are all below.</p>
