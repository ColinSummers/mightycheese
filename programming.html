<h2>Programming</h2>
							Someone recently asked what my programming experience was. In a nutshell, not much. In detail:<br />
<br />
<div>In 1982 I wrote a five hundred line BASIC program on an IBM PC, single floppy machine. My aunt used it for nearly a decade to invoice her clients in a little landscaping business. She had to stop when the sales tax rate changed in New Jersey and the floppy had gobbled the source code.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>In 1985 I took CS100 at Cornell University. It was the lowest level course available (therefore a pre-requisite for all other interesting CS courses). It was filled with undergraduates trying to do the least possible for their computer science requirement. It was a course in top-down programming, and it was taught in Think! Pascal on the Mac (when I last checked in 2001 it was taught in Java). I loved it.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>In 1987 I started programming a lot in Turbo Pascal on various IBM clone machines, all running DOS. I started working for <a href="http://www.sincity.com/">Penn &amp; Teller</a> and wrote an email system for them. This evolved into The Jungle Drum, and it's companion offline reader, Bongo. The community created within the software was called simply, <a href="jungle.html">The Jungle</a>. I continued working as Penn &amp; Teller's computer hacker until Spring 1997. I wrote thousands of lines of Pascal code and MS-DOS batch files.<br />
<br />
In 1989 I took <a href="http://cs211.cs.cornell.edu/index.html">CS211</a> at Cornell. It was also taught in Pascal, but in 2001 they were teaching it in Java. I learned a little more about pointers, and about recursion.<br />
<br />
In the spring of 1997 it became clear that the C++ programmer hired to replace me in Las Vegas, NV was not up to the job of re-creating the Jungle. (It was, at this point, just a discussion group, Penn &amp; Teller moved their own private email needs to Eudora and similar products.) I rewrote the digest software as a <a href="http://www.apple.com/hypercard/">HyperCard</a> stack, linked to the Claris Emailer email client for the Mac OS. The link is accomplished by a couple AppleScript scripts that I didn't write, I just found a guy on the Internet to provide them.<br />
<br />
In June of 1999 I realized that I wanted to bring the technology of The Jungle to a wider audience on the World Wide Web. I tried hiring consultants, but they were all too expensive and wanted hundreds of thousands of dollars. I read <a href="http://arsdigita.com/books/pandt">Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing</a> at the suggestion of a friend. I learned tcl, html, and sql. Another friend set up a Linux box for me and installed Oracle. I worked with <a href="http://deancameron.com">Dean Cameron</a> (who tested and helped with the html) to creat a web service backed by a database. In the first two years it gathered a population of ten thousand users, which was a fine proof-of-concept test for my purposes.<br />
That's it. That's all I've written and learned about programming.<br />
