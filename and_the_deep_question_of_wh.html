Many people ask, what is this "Mighty Cheese?"
<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
It's a homage to my favorite vaudeville act, invented and staged by PT Selbit.
<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
Two guys would roll a large wheel of cheese out onto the stage on its edge (like a wheel should roll). It would stand there. They would invite anyone from the audience up to wrestle the cheese (just knock it over). Of course, huge strapping guys would come up, smile, and kick the top edge of the cheese. The cheese would promptly swing swiftly on its axis and knock the bounder on his arse. The cheese would triumphantly slowly turn in place, accepting applause. The harder someone pushed the top edge, try to knock the cheese over, the harder it would spin and knock them to the floor. If they tried to tackle it, it would shake them off. Eventually the two assistants would declare the Mighty Cheese the winner and roll it off the stage.
<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
If you know some physics, you will love this. Inside the wheel was a flywheel on an axle, spinning madly. Before coming on stage, the men would hook the cheese up to an electric motor and get that mother flying. The cheese was a huge gyroscope. All of the behavior was predictable and expected. Just not from a cheese.
<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
I recently added this detail, which is found in <a href="pt_selbit.html">a chapter of a book on PT Selbit</a> written by <a href="http://www.mcmagicwords.com/" target="_blank">Mike Caveney</a>.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />

Composed in the 1930s in honor of a truly huge cheese created for a state fair in Wisconsin. I believe that this was the 3rd largest cheese ever, although my information could well be out of date.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
No information on how mighty this mighty large cheese is or was.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />

<span><b>Britain Revives Cheeserolling Race</b></span> 04:41 PM ET 05/31/99<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
LONDON (AP) Runners tore down a steep 300-yard course in pursuit of an 8-pound double Gloucester cheese wheel Monday at a revival of the custom of cheeserolling.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
The cheese always comes first, but the person who crosses the finish line right behind the fast-rolling wheel gets to keep it.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
Stephen Brain, 30, of Gloucester, was the big cheese this year, winning all three men's races at Cooper's Hill near Gloucester, 115 miles west of London.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
"The trick is to try and stay on your feet,'' Brain said.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
That isn't so easy. The races were canceled in 1998 because 27 racers were injured in the previous year's competition.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
This year, only one contestant was taken away in an ambulance, and he was not seriously injured.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
Richard Jefferies, a member of the organizing committee, said new safety measures, including crash barriers and a rescue team, paid off. So did a change in time.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
"I think the decision to move it to noon stops people having too much to drink before they come,'' he said.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
According to "The Customs and Ceremonies of Britain,'' cheeserolling was once an event at a big spring celebration that included long-forgotten sports including "grinning for the cake,'' "jumping in the bag,'' and "chattering for a bladder of snuff by old women.''<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
The reference book does not give any further explanation of those games.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />
