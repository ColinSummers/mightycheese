<p><i>We have thee, mammoth cheese,</i></p>
<p><i>Lying quietly at your ease.</i></p>
<p><i>Gently fanned by evening breeze,</i></p>
<p><i>Thy fair form no fly dare seize.</i></p>
<p><i>Pete McCabe...April 16, 1998</i></div>

Composed in the 1930s in honor of a truly huge cheese created for a state fair in Wisconsin. I believe that this was the 3rd largest cheese ever, although my information could well be out of date.</div>
<p>No information on how mighty this mighty large cheese is or was.<br />

<span><b>Britain Revives Cheeserolling Race</b></span> 04:41 PM ET May 31 1999<br />
LONDON (AP) Runners tore down a steep 300-yard course in pursuit of an 8-pound double Gloucester cheese wheel Monday at a revival of the custom of cheeserolling.</p>
<p>The cheese always comes first, but the person who crosses the finish line right behind the fast-rolling wheel gets to keep it.<br />
Stephen Brain, 30, of Gloucester, was the big cheese this year, winning all three men's races at Cooper's Hill near Gloucester, 115 miles west of London.</p>
<p>&quot;The trick is to try and stay on your feet,'' Brain said.</p>
<p>That isn't so easy. The races were canceled in 1998 because 27 racers were injured in the previous year's competition.</p>
<p>This year, only one contestant was taken away in an ambulance, and he was not seriously injured.<br />
Richard Jefferies, a member of the organizing committee, said new safety measures, including crash barriers and a rescue team, paid off. So did a change in time.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the decision to move it to noon stops people having too much to drink before they come,'' he said.<br />
According to &quot;The Customs and Ceremonies of Britain,'' cheeserolling was once an event at a big spring celebration that included long-forgotten sports including &quot;grinning for the cake,'' &quot;jumping in the bag,'' and &quot;chattering for a bladder of snuff by old women.''</p>
<p>The reference book does not give any further explanation of those games.<br />
